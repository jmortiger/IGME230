                <li>
                    A soft clink nudges away the silence of a darkened room. After a small pause, this small sound is followed by another. A little, fragile glow of light begins to illuminate the farthest side of the room. It's muted light casts the shadow of its rather oversized cage onto the floor beyond it. This small cube of color in the otherwise gloomy room is Rainbow. He'd very much like to go home. And he'd be grateful if you could help him.
