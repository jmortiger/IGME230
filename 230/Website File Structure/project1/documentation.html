            DOCUMENTATION FOR PROJECT 1
            I didn't do it because I am very stupid.

            DOCUMENTATION FOR PROJECT 3

            Be sure to submit documentation that details what went right, what went wrong, possible future improvements, what each team mate contributed, and what you each think your grade should be. -20% from final grade if docs are not done.
            This was an unmitigated nightmare, majorly of my own fault and poor estimatation of time constraints. My initial thoughts on tackling this assignment were not planned or thought out at all. As a result, I latched onto what I percieved to be a large flaw with the initial circle blast assignment; the static and non-standard aspect ratio. I was under the assumption that, given that this library is made for an enviroment as resolution unstable as a browser window, there would be at least some functionality to allow for smooth scaling of the canvas as the window changed. This was not the case; however, given the lack of an existing plan, I decided it shouldn't be that large of a problem to independantly create. However, I drastically overestimated the competency of this library, and some features failed to work correctly no matter the circumstances. Regardless, I have majorly achieved this goal (in a rough sense). However, it was at the cost of all other progress on the project.

            I don't know what my grade should be. I didn't come even close to my original goal, but I made a (relatively) large extension that is a very important (in my opinion) contribution given the enviorment.

            FUNCTIONALITIY
            <br /> - Is useful/entertaining: 3/6 (The technology is useful, but the project itself sucks)
            <br /> - Demonstrates creativity: 5/6 (I feel the solution to the problem of an auto scaling resolution w/o depending on resoultion or performance drops (i.e using a coordinate scale of 1.0 by 1.0 instead of an axis defined by pixel dimensions) is a creative and effective way of overcoming the problem, and the implementation of this coordinate system I have never used before is rather inventive.)
            <br /> - Uses an additional HTML5 technology: 6/6 (it uses PIXI.JS)
            <br /> - Runs w/o errors: 6/6 (I'm pretty sure it does)
            <br /> - Functionality is either distinct from the in-class examples, or goes significantly beyond them in scope: 5/6 (functionality arguably doesn't exceed examples, but is distinct and is consructed from the ground up)
            <br />
            <br />DESIGN AND INTERACTION
            <br />Visual design is appealing: 3/5 (ehhhhhhhhhhhh)
            <br />Sound enhances the experience: 0/5 (ughhhhhhhhhhhhhh)
            <br />Interface is clear and well-labeled: 2/5 (I mean, what's there is labeled...)
            <br />Prevents and handles errors well: 5/5 (It does, can't argue this one, plz)
            <br />
            <br />MEDIA/HTML/CSS
            <br />Optimized Images: 3.5/7 (I mean...)
            <br />HTML and CSS validate: 5/5 (I'm pretty sure it does)
            <br />CSS is primarily in a single external stylesheet: 5/5 (I think my usage is a bit better design, as global design is in 1 file and the other one streams that one in and that one is specific to that page, but whatever)
            <br />Makes proper use of structural tags: 5/5 (not much to say)
            <br />Media is unique: 5/5 (Well, it is...)
            <br />
            <br />CODE: 19/20 (Not extensively commented)
