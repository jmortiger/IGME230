            DOCUMENTATION FOR PROJECT 3
            Be sure to submit documentation that details what went right, what went wrong, possible future improvements, what each team mate contributed, and what you each think your grade should be. -20% from final grade if docs are not done.
            This was an unmitigated nightmare, majorly of my own fault and poor estimatation of time constraints. My initial thoughts on tackling this assignment were not planned or thought out at all. As a result, I latched onto what I percieved to be a large flaw with the initial circle blast assignment; the static and non-standard aspect ratio. I was under the assumption that, given that this library is made for an enviroment as resolution unstable as a browser window, there would be at least some functionality to allow for smooth scaling of the canvas as the window changed. This was not the case; however, given the lack of an existing plan, I decided it shouldn't be that large of a problem to independantly create. However, I drastically overestimated the competency of this library, and some features failed to work correctly no matter the circumstances. Regardless, I have majorly achieved this goal (in a rough sense). However, it was at the cost of all other progress on the project.

            I don't know what my grade should be. I didn't come even close t my original goal, but I made a (relatively) large extension that is a very important (in my opinion) contribution given the enviorment.
